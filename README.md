# Implemented requisites
We aim at the 30 mark so we implemented full rules + CLI + GUI + RMI + Socket + 1 F.A.
We chose to implement the Dynamic Scheme Cards F.A.
## Dynamic Scheme Cards
We chose to store the scheme cards in a JSON file with the following structure:

    [
      {
        "front": {
          "name": "Front name",
          "difficulty": 6,
          "patternConstraints": [
            [4, null, null, "green", "red", "blue"],
            [null, 3, null, 6, null, 5],
            ["blue", "yellow", null, "purple", null],
            ["red", null, null, null, null]
          ]
        },
        "back": {
          "name": "Back name",
          "difficulty": 3,
          "patternConstraints": [
            [4, null, null, null, 2, 1],
            [null, "red", "blue", null, null, null],
            [3, null, 3, "green", 5],
            [null, "red", "blue", 1, null]
          ]
        }
      }
     ]

Additionally, all the other cards of the game (Tool Cards, Public and Private Objective Cards) are stored in JSON and
can be easily extended or created anew.

# Usage
Both the client and the server JARs accept command line arguments and gracefully fall back to predefined constants, or
ask the user to supply the needed information.
## Server usage
The server JAR accepts two CLI arguments, the first being the connection timeout and the second being the turn timeout.
One or two or none can be specified, the server will state which values it will use upon launch. The values are assumed
in milliseconds.

Example:

    java -jar Sagrada-Server.jar 10000 120000

## Client usage
The client JAR accepts five CLI positional arguments which are:

    java -jar Sagrada-Client.jar [ui] [hostname] [connection] [username] [port]

In order:

- The preferred UI mode. It has to be one of `cli` or `gui` (case insensitive);
- The server hostname (IP address or FQDN);
- The connection type. It has to be one of `socket` or `rmi` (case insensitive);
- The player's username;
- The server port.

If there's no arguments, or wrong values are supplied, the client asks the user (on the command line) the required
information until a valid choice is entered. If the connection type is `rmi` the port argument is discarded.

Example:

    java -jar Sagrada-Client.jar gui localhost socket tob 3130

# Quirks
Windows' command prompt is not suitable to play this implementation of Sagrada as it does not support color modifiers.
However is it perfectly playable using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows with a proper font (e.g. the tutor provided `DejaVu
Sans Mono for Powerline.ttf`)
